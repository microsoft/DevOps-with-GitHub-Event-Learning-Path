# [ADO40] Delivering Change to the Cloud


###  **Abstract:**
The team at Tailwind Traders has a problem - they're still too dependent on manual processes and key individuals to bring their ideas to customers! While they have successfully implemented a raft of practices that result in trusted builds ready for deployment to the cloud, actually delivering the changes in an effective, trustworthy way is the next challenge. 

Tailwind Traders realises they need to automate their deployments, just as they automated their builds. It's important that they can deliver value quickly, but just as important they catch issues before they get to production with robust pipelines that can deploy to the variety of services their projects require. 

### **Long Description:** 

Tailwind Traders has successfully implemented strategies and processes that ensure developers and operations are collaborating effectively. They've implemented continuous integration and are producing well-tested, trustworthy software, ready for deployment to the cloud. But getting that code into the cloud is their next challenge. 

The team knows they need to automate their deployments just as they automated their builds. And while a comprehensive test suite is important, they need to see running software before it hits production, and be sure they'll get the same result when it's time to go live. In short, they need to move from manual deployments to automated deployments, for all the moving parts of their software and all the cloud services they use. Reducing their dependence on virtual machine-based environments will increase their capacity to build more reliable systems. Automated environment creation and deployment will also allow them to create test environments that mirror production. 

There's a lot to do, but if they can get all this working, they'll have a trustworthy, value-focused, and hands-off delivery pipeline, allowing them to focus on building the best software they can. 

### **User problem:** 

We can build and develop software quickly and securely, but how do we get it into Production safely and consistently?
